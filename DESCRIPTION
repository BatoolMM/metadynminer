Description: Metadynamics is a state of the art biomolecular simulation technique.
  Plumed packages makes it possible to perform metadynamics using various simulation
  codes. The results of metadynamics done in Plumed can be analsed by metadynminer.
  Metadynminer reads 1D and 2D metadynamics HILLS files from Plumed package.
  It uses a fast algorithm to claculate a free energy surface from hills. Minima can
  be located and ploted on the free energy surface. Transition states can be analysed by
  Nudged Elastic Band method. Free energy surfaces, minima and transition paths can be
  ploted to produce publication quality images.
